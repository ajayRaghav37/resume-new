                rebooted and
                revamped to increase quality and intelligence in different services. Improvements made in the
                revamp
                resulted in a <b>reduction of 80% manual effort</b> and a massive <b>1400% quality</b> boost.
                Support for
                knowledge graph was also added during the revamp.
